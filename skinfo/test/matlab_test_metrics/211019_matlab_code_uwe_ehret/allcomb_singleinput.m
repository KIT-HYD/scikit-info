function A = allcomb_singleinput(bla)

% Uwe Ehret, 30.7.2017
% This is a modified version of function 'allcomb' by Jos van der Geest, downloaded from Matlab
% Fileexchange in version 4.1. Version 4.2 of allcomb is available at 
% https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10064-allcomb-varargin

% allcomb_singleinput does the same thing as allcomb, but
% input is not provided as collection of individual arrays (A, B, C)
% but as a single [1,n] cell array, where n is the number of formerly individual arrays
% so bla(1,1) = A, bla(1,2) = B etc.
% changes from the original code are indicated by 'UE'
